          <p>Ginger Berglund is honored to carry on the legacies of June Christy and Anita O'Day with the Stan Kenton Alumni Band.  Her multi-faceted career now includes singing  with The Modernaires, the quintessential close harmony vocal group featured with the Glen Miller Orchestra. She also duets with her husband, Scott Whitfield, renowned trombonist, arranger and singer.</p>

          <p>She recorded for the Tonight Show originator and host, Steve Allen, and with the great pianist Paul Smith.  She has sung duets with the smooth and soaring voice of Kenny Rankin. While in college, she sang with the St. Olaf Choir and managed to also perform in St. Olaf's music theatre, including a "Jacques Brel is Alive And Well..." and a Lincoln Center Theatre award winning "Godspell".</p>

          <p>Ginger is most proud of "Dreamsville", her duo album with Scott. It's full of smooth harmonies reminiscent of Jackie Cain &amp; Roy Kral's vocal creations and Scott's "swingmeister" arrangements. It features a comprehensive and stunning solo interpretation of the Fran Landesman/Tommy Wolf song, "Listen, Little Girl" with the Grammy award winning pianist and arranger, Bob Florence.</p>

          <p>Ginger cut her teeth in the music business working for the great Brazilian jazz vocalist Flora Purim and her husband, the premiere fusion jazz percussionist Airto Moreira. She is a featured singer with many local Los Angeles bands including the Tracy Wells Big Band, the Scott Whitfield Jazz Orchestra, and the Jumpin' Joz Band. She's worked acting and singing in commercials, and recorded for many songwriters, both classical and popular.</p>

          <p>Admitted to the Screen Actor's Guild for her work in the comedy movie "Kiss My Grits, " she also appeared in the Martin Scorsese film "The King of Comedy" in the "Marty undercover" scene with Jerry Lewis and Tony Randall.</p>

          <p>Daughter of a rocket engineer and a professional Girl Scout, Ginger is a native of Pasadena, CA. She knows the Girl Scout "fake book" by heart.  She was the cornerstone of her little Lutheran church kid's choir, got her first break at 16, debuting with Pasadena's favorite choral director, Jim Coday, and singing with his group "Vanity Fair" at Ronald Reagan's Gubernatorial Inaugural Ball. The group performed at every major hotel venue in LA, and at the Dodger Stadium Fourth of July Family Show and Mitzi Gaynor's Christmas Show at LA's Shrine Auditorium.</p>

          <p>Ginger's talents have led her, until recently, to hang on to her "day job" and thank her lucky stars for their breadth and legacy. She worked for Jane Fonda's Workout. She helped to start the University of California at San Diego's Rady School of Mgt. While at UCLA's Anderson School of Business, her work with international MBA schools gave her opportunities to sing all over the world during academic conferences.  Her commuter image, (while singing, of course) is permanently etched into the artwork of the Pasadena Gold Line, Lake Metro station west.</p>
