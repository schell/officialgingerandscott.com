    <p>Scott Whitfield (trombonist, composer, arranger, and vocalist) is
    internationally recognized for his work with contemporary big bands,
    including those of Toshiko Akiyoshi, Bob Florence, Clare Fischer,
    Johnny Mandel, Bill Holman, Phil Norman Tentet, Glen Miller Orchestra,
    Stan Kenton Alumni Band and Jimmy Dorsey Band, as well as his
    own Scott Whitfield Jazz Orchestras (East AND West). In addition to
    Scott’s own recordings, his compositions and arrangements have been
    performed and recorded by such artists as Diva, Maurice Hines, The
    Pied Pipers, The Modernaires, Bill Allred’s Classic Jazz Band, and Pete
    Petersen’s 23-strong Collection Jazz Orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>Scott’s playing, writing, and singing have been compared to that of
    some of his biggest influences, including Carl Fontana, Frank Rosolino,
    Thad Jones, Sammy Nestico, Mel Torme, and Jack Jones. While jazz
    ensemble composition and arranging is his forte, he’s arranged for the
    Omaha Philharmonic and The New York City Pops Orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>Settling in New York in 1993, Scott became a member of the Nat
    Adderley Sextet, which also included Jimmy Cobb, Walter Booker,
    Vincent Herring and Rob Bargad. The group’s engagements at
    Sweet Basil led to fruitful associations with Nnenna Freelon, Frank
    Wess, Lionel Hampton, Wayne Andre, and many others. He has also
    performed in many Broadway show orchestras, and backed the likes of
    Robert Goulet, Rita Moreno, Marilyn McCoo, Vic Damone, Jack Jones,
    Nancy Wilson, Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra, Jr., Patti Austin, and a host
    of others.
    </p>
    <p>Scott served on the jazz faculty at Rutgers University from 1998
    to 2002, teaching trombone, composition and arranging, and
    improvisation, while also coordinating the school’s combo program.
    Scott is a Getzen artist, and has appeared throughout the world, from
    Australia to Zurich, sharing his expertise on trombone technique,
    improvisation, composition, arranging, and jazz history.
    The Scott Whitfield Jazz Orchestra (first founded in 1986, while Scott
    was pursuing his Master’s degree at North Texas State University) now
    has two incarnations: the SWJO East, based in New York; and the
    SWJO West, based in Whitfield’s new home of Los Angeles. Both of
    these aggregations feature the top players in the business. For more
    than a year, the SWJO East was in residence at New York’s Birdland,
    the Jazz Corner of the World.
